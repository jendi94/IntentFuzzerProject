# IntentFuzzerProject
A POC of an IntentFuzzer for Android. This application serves as an example of a null fuzzing mechanism that is capable of sending empty intents to Activities, Services and BroadcastReceivers.
A logging mechanism has also been added in order to allow the possibility of viewing stack traces of exceptions caused by sending bad intents.
